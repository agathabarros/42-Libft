# 42-Libft
This document provides information about the Libft project for 42 - Common Core, including a list of mandatory functions such as ft_isalpha, ft_isdigit, ft_strlen, and others. 

To build the library, simply run the following command in the repository's root directory:

Mandatory : make

Bonus Part: make bonus

This will generate the libft.a file, which can be linked to your C project.

# Mandatory Functions

### [Makefile](https://github.com/agathabarros/42-Libft/blob/master/Makefile)
The makefile is a file used to automate the compilation of programs into a project. It is composed of rules that specify the dependencies between files and the actions that must be followed to build the project.

### [Libft.h](https://github.com/agathabarros/42-Libft/blob/master/libft.h)
This is a header file for a C language library called libft, which is a library of common functions written for use in future projects. This header includes several function declarations as well as a structure that will be used for implementing the extra bonus functions.
